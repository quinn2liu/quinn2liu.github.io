                <h2>week 2</h2>
                <p>
                    While first reading Ulises' writing, I couldn't help but think of how his analysis of the postal system is an analogy for how we use the internet to share ideas and be creative today. As someone who has grown up after the World Wide Web movement, this connection is pretty clear to see, but for his peers who were reading this as it was published, however, this would feel like a strangely specific speculation. I find his discussion about the production of mail art to be particularly interesting to think about in a modern context. To be specific, I'm curious as to whether it's still the case where creators have "absolute" control between the production of the piece, and "no control at all" with regards to posting the piece.

                    <p>1. In the present, does the internet provide artists more or less control as to the way they share their work?</p>

                    <p>2. Do artists need to get an "answer" after sharing their work? Is that what "harmony" looks like?</p>
                </p>
                <h2>week 3</h2>
                <p>
                    At the start, I enjoyed the author's dialogue surrounding the current state of the internet. In the past, what makes a "website" was relatively simple. It was easy to express one's self given the relative simplicity of creating your own website and only needing to learn a few tools while at it. Compared to now, the modern website is a much more mysterious contraption, with countless steps to even make it functional. The author then believes that instead of viewing the internet as this "cloud" of information, all homogenous, we as users should reclaim the original idea of the internet, as a web of individual nodes that are all interconnected. They then expand on this thought when talking about the importance of always learning from others' perspectives and not getting trapped in one's beliefs, in the sense of using the internet and its web of links to branch out. "Surf—don’t search—the web". 

                    <p>1. Using the analogies like room, puddle, garden, how can we categorize most websites today?</p>

                    <p>2. With the ways most people interact with the internet these days, is it easier or harder for people to create their own "knowledge networks" or not?</p>
                </p>
                <h2>week 4</h2>
                <p>
                    While it is sad that Geocities was taken down from the internet, I really appreciated Lialina's point about how it allows us to have a snapshot into the past of the internet. Many long-standing services on the internet have gone through modern transformations, without their previous iterations being preserved or documented. With Geocities' life being cut short yet still preserved, it's a unique artifact of its time. It was also an interesting case study as to the interconnectivity of the web, where other services could be rendered useless based on the health of a completely separate one. This is one of the main reasons why the author believes you can't "get old" on the web, as websites that last 10 years are incredibly rare. 

                    <p>1. What service, if it went down today, would cause the largest destruction on the internet?</p>

                    <p>2. Are we past the point in the development of the internet to have a Geocities-level deletion to happen?</p>
                </p>
                <h2>week 5</h2>
                <p>
                    This reading starts off explaining the idea of Gestalt psychology and the idea that the whole is sometimes completely different and even greater than the sum of its parts. The author uses this principal to highlight the idea that visual things should be not just be thought of as "something that happens," but rather their own type of "visual event." It was interesting to hear about how this applies to the digital watch, something that we take as a static image, but is actually a series of images strung together to look like one that is still. It was then interesting to see this sentiment, to design with the goal of giving viewers a feeling that is more than the literal image, started to appear in all sorts of industries and examples. 

                    <p>1. Do designers, specifically logo designers, still use Gestalt Psychology in their work today?</p>

                    <p>2. When do old examples of Gestalt Psychology in design, like how floppy disks signify the act of saving something, become obsolete? Will they ever be considered obsolete?</p>
                </p>
                <h2>week 6</h2>
                <p>
                    On the discussion of the evolution of digital media and how the power of digital media lies more with the networking opportunities, I think it's interesting to see what the author is talking about fold out in front of us today. We're seeing AI technologies starting to be able to compose drawings, animation, and audio from simple text prompts, but the main way that we still interact with art and media is through the networking apps and platforms made possible through digitization.

                    <p>It's interesting to hear how much the author believes that print and digital media will intertwine. In the example of the QR code, their theory of it being used as ever-updating content in the physical world isn't wrong, but at least today we haven't seen it be widely used in that sense outside of purely informational uses.</p>It's interesting to hear how much the author believes that print and digital media will intertwine. In the example of the QR code, their theory of it being used as ever-updating content in the physical world isn't wrong, but at least today we haven't seen it be widely used in that sense outside of purely informational uses.

                    <p>Lastly, I did want to note that I  agree with their opinion regarding how using physical mediums for media in the present day is seen as a choice away from the norm, and any media using print as the medium carries a certain ideology with it. </p>

                    <p>1. Is there still room for innovation with physical media? Is the only option for innovation to integrate it with digital technologies?</p>

                    <p>2. Is it even possible to have post-digital print that can be shared and networked at a similar level as if it was digital</p>
                </p>
                <h2>week 8</h2>
                <p>
                    While this reading serves as an exploration of the creative possibilities of alt-text, I did appreciate the fact that the authors ultimately stress the importance of staying true to the purpose of alt-text, where "it is important to stay rooted in alt-text as an accessibility practice." With that being said, I agree with the authors that there is a fine line between describing the image as is and also providing commentary on the sentiment or message behind the image. Regardless of the approach, however, one thing that is guaranteed is the loss of information. The nature of screen readers means that your descriptions cannot be egregiously-long, meaning that every description must adhere to being relatively concise.

                    <p>1. I wonder if there's any academic research into the optimal length of alt-text descriptions? Personally, I don't think I could process more than a sentence, but I know that people who are visually impaired probably have a better verbal attention span.</p>

                    <p>2. I understand that there are guidelines in place for alt-text best practices, but I'm wondering if there has ever been a discussion to standardize the format of alt-text to convey the most information as possible. If this doesn't exist, what is the reasoning for it? Is it to preserve the creative freedom of the author?</p>
                </p>
                <h2>week 9</h2>
                <p>
                    Given the history of software and computer programming, and the fact that we life in the US, the accessibility of programming isn't something I necessarily think about. But if I'm not mistaken, English (or words resembling it) is the only language in which it's possible to program in. When you traditionally hear about bias in programming, it's usually regarding some sort of machine learning algorithm that is creating harmful generalizations. But as Nasser mentions, the act of programming has been and currently is biased from the start given its English-centric nature. This then begs the question for "what can be done about this," but as the author mentions, there's arguably too much inertia in the world of computer science. 

                    <p>1. While it's relatively fine that English is the language used for programming given the fact that it's the "global" language, what would life have looked like if programming was originally developed by a non-english speaking country? Would scholars in the US have overcome the initial inertia to to develop English-based programming syntax?</p>

                    <p>2. Have we reached the stage where most major technology companies' hardware and software are usable for all languages? How much do people need to know about technology to be considered "technologically literate"?</p>

                    <p>This is a meme I saw a long time ago that I think would be relevant here:</p>
                </p>
                <img id="inshallah" src="../src/inshallah.jpg" alt="">
                <h2>week 10</h2>
                <p>
                    While it is easy to view graphic design as strictly the content that we view, Duvall highlights the importance of the "surface", or actual medium that this content is delivered to us. In a postmodern world, Duvall argues that in the digital world, the prevalence of screens being the primary medium of content has driven a wave of anti-digital themes, for example typography mimicking human writing. Duvall then predicts that after postmodernism, the next cultural movement will be one where the computer and its icons are the starting point of a web of signs that take on many meanings (hypermodernism). One he mentions is the alternative use cases of Mickey Mouse in the 1900s, and how it was often used by designers that "have largely rejected the traditional client/designer-relationship." 

                    <p>1. What is the shelf life of the meaning of an icon such as Mickey Mouse? In present day, I would argue that for the majority of the public, the symbol's "learned" meaning of rebellion has been lost.</p>

                    <p>2. How much of the Mickey Mouse icon's power came from the actual popularity of the character vs the real-world events at the time that took advantage of it?   </p>
                </p>
                <h2>week 12</h2>
                <p>
                    Before learning about String Games, I hadn't realized how similar programming and games are. Both feature a clearly-defined set of rules that must be solid so that there is no room for error. In the case of games, all it takes is one loophole for a player to exploit and ruin the experience. In the case of programming, one small typo or bug in the code can cause all sorts of unexpected and problematic behavior. One special aspect about games, and to an extent some programs, is that while they must have a strict set of rules, they are also playgrounds for the users to explore and make decisions in, similar to how String Games and Mandela lets the users make their own decisions given the confines of the artwork. 

                    <p>I think the discussion about how Frenkel treats virtual entities as a sort of "memory", in which its use is meant to create a sense of disappearing is particularly interesting. While at a large scale, files stored on the web or in the cloud these days feels permanent, it's still a reality that anything we have personally stored on our personal computers is at risk of being lost.</p>

                    <p>1. While we take the information and infrastructure of the internet as a given these days, what would life be like if the internet could just disappear, like a memory?</p>

                    <p>2. This may be more of a factual question than discussion-oriented, but how prevalent was "performance art" before the existence of video recording? Much of the reading discusses physical performance of art without the records to replay it, so I am curious about the history of performance art and whether there is any correlation with the development of video recording.</p>
                </p>
                <h2>week 13</h2>
                <p>
                    I think Soulellis brings up an interesting point at the start of the reading, where any sort of "post" or showing of information in a public setting is meant to interrupt you and what you're doing, meaning that it's going to be designed in a way that will be as attention-grabbing as possible. Interestingly, though, the rise of live-streaming challenges these notions as there is inherently no defined start or end. Soulellis then brings up how it's this uncertainty with which why streaming has become so popular, as anything could happen at any time. This perspective makes the idea that "social media is where the new boredom thrives" so much more potent, as society's tolerance and desire to see and be seen has increased exponentially. It was also interesting to see the parallels between modern "autogenerated" content and traditional examples, like the world market book. While it's easy to point out the faults and "laziness" behind autogenerated YouTube videos, a similar thing can be said for fluff books and traditional media. At the end of the reading, Soulellis ends his thoughts by introducing the idea of AI-generated content, or what he argues essentially as a sea of speculative content, being created from existing content, feeling almost like a loop. I agree with his sentiment regarding how we as people need to change the way we view media to be able to spot out and understand what we're seeing. At least as someone who is studying computer science, I feel biased because I already have the tools and knowledge to try and comprehend this new wave of content, but the majority of the public may not.

                    <p>1. Will generation alpha, which I believe is the first generation to be born with technology fully integrated into everyday life, see real developmental issues as result of this? Will generation z?</p>

                    <p>2. After the large language model boom, it seems like most of the big players in the AI space are trying to create conversational models, or ones with voices that you can talk to. Do you/we think this will catch on or just be another gimmick.</p>
                </p>
                <h2>week 14</h2>
                <p>
                    I think that while society often preaches the idea that internet/technology can champion education and bring opportunities for all, this reading brings up the important fact that we must remember that the internet is as malleable as the people who use it. Outside of the explanation given by the reading, I personally viewed "The Way" as an analogy to perspective, where at least for me, constantly being on the internet and scrolling through websites makes me lose perspective incredibly fast. By the end of the reading when Gem was trying to get to the volunteer center as soon as possible, I also felt myself wanting to just turn my laptop off so I could get away from screens. On a side note, it's so refreshing to read something with illustrations. I've never realized how often I just stare at a wall of text. 

                    <p>1. Does the internet give people more or less perspective in life?</p>

                    <p>2. I'm curious if there are more examples of biases specifically regarding hardware, other than master-slave terminology. </p>
                </p>
                <h2>week 15</h2>
                <p>
                    While I understand the author's belief that framing is an important part of an artwork's context, I'm not sure I agree with the opinion that framing becomes deinstitutionalized on the internet. Most up-and-coming artists these days, who see the internet as the main way to share their work, are looking to put their art in pre-existing institutions and platforms to gain exposure. While most of the time they have their own platform or home for their work, it's often that people's first exposure to someone's work is through a shared, social media platform. I do, however, agree with the sentiment that the internet allows artists to further curate their presence and how their work/persona is presented to the world. I found the discussion around the "gaze" of others especially interesting. One somewhat new trend, or idea, I've been seeing on the internet has been a lot of self-care content, specifically targeted towards young men. One idea that I see this content repeat a lot has been some variation of "improve in silence so that others don't know." While I understood the sentiment and reasoning for this mindset before this reading, it was interesting to trace this self-care, productivity mindset to something that originated from artists and their practices. 

                    <p>1. Will there be an "archive" for art after the internet?</p>

                    <p>2. Has the internet given people more or less control over their identity?</p>
