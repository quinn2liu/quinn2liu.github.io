            eating a burger and fries. They appear sad, with a slouched posture and a distant gaze, 
            wearing a casual hoodie and jeans. The setting features McDonald's signature red and yellow decor, 
            bright fluorescent lighting, and a partially eaten meal on the table. 
            The atmosphere feels quiet and melancholic, contrasting with the typically lively 
            environment of a fast-food chain." class="mcd">
